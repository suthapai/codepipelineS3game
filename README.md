# codepipelineS3game

AWS CodePipeline automates building, testing and deploying your projects.  Just choose where your code lives, say where you want it to be deployed to, and—MAGIC!—CodePipeline makes it happen.

In this hands-on tutorial, we’ll build a simple memory card game (using memes, no less!) using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  The code will live in GitHub (you can fork the repo provided).  We’ll then create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.  And from there, we’ll create a CodePipeline that pulls from GitHub and deploys to the S3 bucket.
